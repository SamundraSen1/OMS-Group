               1. DAMAGED ITEM

Every item and every part is thoroughly inspected prior to despatch. All our items come with superior packing materials. Every care is taken to ensure individual parts are securely wrapped and are damage-proof during travel. We take these measures to provide quality service.

Please check the items thoroughly for any damage as soon as you receive them and prior to installation. Ensure great care while taking out fragile parts from the carton box and removing the packaging.

Please note the following:

Kindly report any breakage or damage to the items within 3 days from receipt of the items to sales@lightosphere.com.au. Insurance cover requires claims to be made immediately and hence any issues reported after this timeframe will not be considered for free of charge replacement.
You will be eligible for a free of charge replacement of the damaged item or damaged parts as the case may be. This does not constitute a refund. If the item is not in stock, a store voucher (redeemable at Lightosphere) for the order value will be provided.
When you report breakage or damages, you will be required to explain the issue and provide photos to substantiate the situation for claims purposes.
You may be required to provide a copy of the order confirmation or invoice as proof of purchase.
In certain situations, you may be requested to send the item back to us at our expense for us to validate and process the claim.
You will be subject to pay $50 admin fee if the claim was misrepresented.
Any physical damage, abuse, misuse, unauthorised repair or tampering of parts will make your claim invalid.
If the item is considered not to be damaged, we are in no obligation to provide you a free of charge replacement. You will be charged misrepresentation fees listed above plus shipping fees for sending the item back to you.
Please allow 3 days for us to process your claim and provide a response.

The shipping method adopted for sending you the replacement item or parts will be same as the original order shipping. Please contact us in case you need your item urgently though express service. You will be charged additional costs.
